  /* Boot header for serial NOR FlexSPI XIP.
   *
   * It's 'XIP' in that it starts executing instructions
   * from flash immediately out of reset. The runtime then
   * manually copies instructions (data, etc.), and we jump
   * to that. After that jump, we're no longer XIP.
   *
   * The i.MX RT boot ROM also supports a way to copy the
   * application image by changing the boot data configuration.
   * Specifically, point the 'start of image' to somewhere other
   * than the start of flash, and specify how many bytes to copy.
   * The boot ROM copies the image, then jumps to the vector table.
   * There's a catch: the boot ROM copies the first 8K from the
   * start of flash too. This represents the entire boot header,
   * including the FCB, IVT, and boot data. (NXP docs say that the
   * initial load region is 4K; my testing shows that it's 8K, and
   * this aligns with observations of others.) If you ever want to
   * try this, make sure you're specifing the VMA and LMA of the
   * boot head section to represent this 8K relocation.
